<p>
Joda-Money is a small Java library providing classes to store, format and parse amounts of money.
This is a brief user guide to the features available.
</p>
</section>


<section name="Main classes">
<p>
There are two main classes which are both based on <code>BigDecimal</code>:
<ul>
<li><b><code>Money</code></b> - an amount in a single currency where the decimal places is determined by the currency</li>
<li><b><code>BigMoney</code></b> - an amount in a single currency where there is no restriction on the scale</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For example, the currencies of US dollars, Euros and British Pounds all use 2 decimal places,
thus a <code>Money</code> instance for any of these currencies will have 2 decimal places.
By contrast, the Japanese Yen has 0 decimal places, and thus any <code>Money</code> instance with that
currency will have 0 decimal places.
</p>
<p>
Instances of <code>BigMoney</code> may have a scale that is positive or zero.
Negative scales are normalized to zero.
</p>
<p>
Conversion between a <code>Money</code> and a <code>BigMoney</code> can be performed using the methods
<code>toBigMoney()</code> and <code>toMoney()</code>. The latter optionally takes a rounding mode to
handle the case where information must be lost.
</p>
<p>
Both classes implement the <code>BigMoneyProvider</code> interface.
This allows many different classes, including user supplied classes, to interoperate with Joda-Money.
In application code, the best advice is to use the concrete types.
However, utility and framework code will typically use the interface.
The formatting code is a good example of this.
</p>
</section>


<section name="Currency information">
<p>
Joda-Money includes its own currency class as the implementation in the JDK is too restrictive.
The data for the Joda-Money class is provided by two configuration files.
</p>
<p>
The file <code>org/joda/money/CurrencyData.csv</code> holds a basic list of valid currencies.
The columns are as follows:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO-4217</a> currency code - three letters, mandatory</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO-4217</a> numeric code - from 1 to 999, set to -1 if no numeric code</li>
<li>Number of decimal places in common usage - the supplied data is based on various sources</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you place a file on the classpath named <code>META-INF/org/joda/money/CurrencyDataExtension.csv</code>
then the data it contains will augment and replace the base data.
The extension file has the same format as the base file.
</p>
<p>
The file <code>org/joda/money/CountryData.csv</code> holds a mapping from ISO-3166 country code to currency.
The columns are as follows:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">ISO-3166-1</a> country code - two letters, mandatory</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO-4217</a> currency code - three letters, mandatory</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you place a file on the classpath named <code>META-INF/org/joda/money/CountryDataExtension.csv</code>
then the data it contains will augment and replace the base data.
The extension file has the same format as the base file.
</p>
<p>
(Note that in previous versions, these data files had different names and different formats.)
</p>
</section>


<section name="Formatting">
<p>
Formatting is based around the <code>MoneyFormatterBuilder</code> class.
The builder is used to create a suitable format which is then converted to an immutable <code>MoneyFormatter</code> instance.
The format may contain localized aspects which can be use by calling <code>withLocale()</code> on the formatter.
This returns a new formatter as it is immutable.
</p>
<p>
The symbol information for formatting is currently provided by the JDK.
